### Capstone Project:

## Gmail Clone:

# Frontend Development:

> Used Material UI and bootstrap for building a dynamic and interactive UI.
> Created separate components for the login and registration forms.
> Used React state and Formik to manage form inputs and validation messages. 
> Utilized React Router for handling client-side routing.
> Implemented the Context API for state management across the application. 

# Backend Development:

> Set up Node.js and Express.js for creating RESTful APIs to handle requests and responses.
> Used MongoDB for storing and managing tasks, user data, and authentication details.
> Implement JWT, and Bcrypt for secure access.
> Integrate middleware for user permissions and role-based access control. (Couldn't complete this part, Though I have added the auth file, I could able to integrate. I had raised query, Since it's weekend no one picked up my query and the deadline is 22/6/2024, I had to submit the task, I definitely workon the middleware integration)
